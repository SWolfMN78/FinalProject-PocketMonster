# FinalProject-PocketMonster
My Java Final Project 
   This project is intended to be a mixture of tomogouchi and a fitness pal application where the user can log their results in and keep
   running record of how they are progressing.  Their pocket moster will change and developer with them, adjusting slightly as the user works
   through their fitness goals.

Features:
  Create new users
  Save personal information to a databse
  Chart measurements and weight.
  Chart water consumed
    Evenutally play games with your pocket monster.
  Print information on the user's progress from SQL to a txt document.
